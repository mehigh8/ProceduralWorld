# ProceduralWorld
<b>Roșu Mihai Cosmin</b>

Project made for the Procedural Generation course of the Graphics, Multimedia and Virtual Reality master program.

## Details

Small 3D game that uses several procedural generation algorithms in order to create the terrain, plants, npcs, items and dungeons.

<b>Terrain</b>
- The terrain was created using fractal noise on a Terrain type object from Unity.

<b>Plants</b>
- The plants were created using L-Systems adapted for 3D, together with LineRenderers.

<b>NPCs and Items</b>
- Each NPC is randomly generated by picking its name, personality and class from predefined lists of values. Health and damage values are picked randomly from different ranges.
- Each item is randomly generated by picking its type and ability from predefined lists of values. Rarity, damage and durability values are picked randomly from different ranges.

<b>Dungeons</b>
- Each dungeon was created using the BSP algorithm to generate multiple rooms which are then connected.
